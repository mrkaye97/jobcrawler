    <h1>Hi! Welcome to Jobcrawler</h1>
    <p>This is a tool for <i>passive</i> job searching. It will send you notifications when a company you love posts a
        new job that matches your
        interests. This way, you can keep up to date with new jobs at companies you're interested in without constantly
        needing to check their job boards.</p>
    <p>If you're actively hunting, it might be better to use a more feature-complete job aggregator. But if you have a
        shortlist of companies you'd like to work at and want to be able to pounce on a new opportunity they post at any
        given time, this
        might just be the tool for you!</p>
    <p>Feel free to <a href="mailto:mrkaye97@gmail.com">email me</a> or submit an issue on <a
            href="https://github.com/mrkaye97/jobcrawler/issues">the app's Github repo</a> with
        suggestions for improvements or new feature requests!</p>
